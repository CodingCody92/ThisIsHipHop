                    <p>To Pimp a Butterfly isn’t just another album, and Kendrick Lamar isn’t just another rapper.
                        Kendrick
                        is different. His first major label album, good kid, m.A.A.d city is one of the greatest rap
                        albums
                        of all time. The last two artists who debuted with albums that redefined the genre were Kanye
                        West
                        (The College Dropout) and Jay Z (Reasonable Doubt). Good kid, m.A.A.d city, was an
                        autobiographical
                        masterpiece that vocalized the struggle of growing up in dire circumstances in Compton and how
                        it
                        affected Kendrick’s perception of the world. It was brilliant and clever, a concept album that
                        still
                        told Kendrick’s "how I got here" story. He could have used the same blueprint for his second
                        album.
                        It worked once, and Kendrick is talented enough to make use of it again. Rappers rapping about
                        their
                        upbringing will never end, but Kendrick Lamar isn’t conventional in the least.</p>

                    <p>
                        We knew Kendrick was going with a new concept for this album. It wasn’t going to be your
                        traditional 808-laden, two-club-hits-and-a-love-song hip-hop album. But Kendrick was never that
                        to begin with. It was going to be soulful — conscious as they say. He gave us "i" back in
                        September, an uplifting track about self-love — there’s an updated (see: much better) version of
                        "i" on the album that sampled The Isley Brothers. We got a taste of the new musical arrangements
                        back in December on The Colbert Report when he performed an untitled song that if released would
                        probably have been the best song of 2014 (it didn’t even make the album). Then we got the
                        artwork for To Pimp a Butterfly. If the direction of the album wasn’t clear before, it was now.
                        This is about to be some social commentary / Black Excellence music. I wasn’t scared that
                        Kendrick would deliver a flop. I was afraid that he would only dip a toe into the pool of Black
                        Excellence music, that he would hesitate to speak on social issues, or succumb to label pressure
                        to provide a few radio-friendly records. He didn’t. Not one bit.

                    <p>To Pimp a Butterfly is perfect. There’s no other adjective that can properly convey its
                        greatness. To Pimp a Butterfly is an immaculate amalgamation of rap, jazz, funk, soul, and
                        spoken word. It cannot be restricted by a single genre. It’s the latest evolution of Black
                        Music, and it’s nothing short of genius. (Black Music, inhabited by the likes of Curtis
                        Mayfield, James Brown, Prince, the Fugees, Andre 3000, and D’Angelo. A land where the natural
                        barriers of music don’t exist. A place where the main goal is the advancement and protection of
                        the culture.)

                        Crafted with a live band consisting of Bilal, Thundercat, Terrace Martin, and Anna Wise — all
                        talented artists in their own right — To Pimp a Butterfly pulls no punches. The first track,
                        "Wesley’s Theory" featuring George Clinton and Thundercat and produced by Flying Lotus sets the
                        tone, opens with a sample of Boris Gardiner’s 1974 song "Every Nigger is a Star." On "Wesley’s
                        Theory" Kendrick tackles consumerism and rampant debt that plagues black entertainers, something
                        that he has (so far) seemingly avoided. Speaking first from the perspective of a young black
                        musician forecasting his downfall into the trap of wealth and greed ("When I get signed, homie
                        I'mma act a fool / Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room"), and then from the
                        perspective of "Uncle Sam" who encourages him to buy everything on credit ("What you want you? /
                        A house or a car? / Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar? / Anything, see, my name is Uncle
                        Sam on your dollar / Motherfucker you can live at the mall").

                        Before that, partying plays its part in this enlightenment project. Lamar and his team of
                        producers – returnee Pharrell Williams on the stuttering, three-legged pop tune Alright;
                        avant-hip-hop man Flying Lotus on Wesley’s Theory ; and a busy cast of up’n’comers – are not
                        averse to getting down. We’ve already heard i, a party banger ostensibly about Lamar’s prowess
                        (there is a new outro in which the N-word is rewritten as “negus”, an east African word meaning
                        “emperor”).

                        Ultimately, though, …Butterfly is closer to the preview provided by album teaser The Blacker the
                        Berry – a furious diatribe about race whose roll is as heavy and relentless as its messages –
                        than it is to i. The album is linked by an unfolding voiceover in which Lamar discusses his
                        inner conflict, depression, the temptations of “Lucy” (the devil in the guise of a groupie) and
                        false epiphanies.

                    <p>
                        It all ends with a slightly overbaked conversation between Lamar and the (sampled) late Tupac
                        Shakur, which seems to predict an uprising, while Lamar’s extended metaphor of a caterpillar
                        turning into a butterfly begs for greater self-knowledge and transcendence. That bit might get
                        old quickly. The rest won’t.
