                        all in four years, and he's the genre's biggest pop crossover star. His new album is a dimly lit
                        affair, both morose and triumphant; as Drake albums go, this is the Drakiest.</h4>

                        The progression is palpable. His third studio album, "Nothing Was the Same," features a
                        self-aware artist, sure of himself and of the talent of his right-hand man, producer Noah "40"
                        Shebib. 40, who co-produced the majority of the album, has mastered his dark, lush sound, easing
                        the fluidity of the album while mixing inspiration like Houston rap and 90s R&B. Each song is a
                        lucid story of its own, in which Drake reveals more of himself, from who he was once to who he's
                        becoming. The storytelling is filled with flashbacks, acceptance of wrongdoing and unshakeable
                        pride.

                    <p>As Drake albums go, this is the Drakiest: Except for Jay Z, who shows up at the end of the album,
                        Nothing Was the Same is an entirely solo affair, and all of Drake's tendencies are dialed up.
                        Even for a rapper known for sniping at non-famous girlfriends on record, he's breathtakingly
                        petty here: The album is four days old on the internet, and already his line "The one that I
                        needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree/ I've always been feeling like she was the piece
                        to complete me" from "From Time" is infamous, a reference so specific that the actual Courtney
                        has had to put a padlock on her social-media life. Drake has been talking to old flames who have
                        no equivalent soap box to climb on to talk back since before "CeCe's Interlude", of course, but
                        as he's gotten more famous, they've grown more malicious, and here they feel like a series of
                        emotional drone strikes. </p>

                    <p>On "Paris Morton Music", he relishes the thought of showing up at his high school reunion,
                        watching everyone "go through security clearance," and on "Too Much", he airs out his family:
                        "Money got my family going backwards/ No dinners, no holidays, no nothing," he laments, before
                        going in on his uncle, his cousins, and even his mother: "I hate the fact that my mom cooped up
                        in the apartment, telling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit like
                        that's true shit." Drake recently performed this song on Jimmy Fallon, apologizing briefly to
                        his family before tearing into it. The album title, in context, reads like a self-fulfilling
                        prophecy viewed from the rear view, an acknowledgment that he's cutting final ties, torching the
                        last bridges. He might like who he's become, but you can hear he doesn't expect anyone else to.

                    <p>That's okay: Loneliness, self-afflicted or otherwise, has always been Drake's most reliable fuel.
                        His albums draw strength from their insularity; when everyone outside them in mainstream rap was
                        piling on epic minor-key horns and turning their songs into armored tanks, Drake drew the
                        curtains. His sound was set apart more by what wasn't there-- snare claps, hi-hats-- then what
                        was. Nothing Was the Same is Drake and 40's most audacious experiment yet in how far inward they
                        can push their sound; a lot of the album sounds like a black hole of all 40's previous
                        productions being sucked into the center. Song-to-song transitions, which have always been melty
                        and blurry, are more notional than ever. "Wu-Tang Forever" is a sunken glimmer of piano with a
                        tiny tag of RZA's voice, screaming "It's Yourz," before shading, at some point, into "Own It".

                    <p>There is no uncomplicated forward motion in Drake songs; usually one small element worms forward
                        while everything sits around it, a haze of rhythmic and harmonic indecision. Drake continues his
                        qualified, complicated claiming of Houston on Nothing, rapping "I was birthed there in my first
                        year, man I know that place like I come from it" on "Too Much". But the only quality his music
                        shares with Houston rap is its vague relationship to momentum. On "Started From the Bottom", the
                        bass isn't even a settled pitch, but a buckling floor beneath the destabilized-sounding pianos,
                        which scrabble down its side. "305 to My City" sits almost completely flat, a ticking snare the
                        only indication of a pulse.</p>

                    <p>There are big, friendly singles as well-- notably, the bar-mitzvah floor-filler "Hold On, We're
                        Going Home", which borrows its smoothly bumping glide from "Sexual Healing". The song is
                        terrific, one of Drake's best pure pop songs ever and instantly a standard. It is also out of
                        place on this dimly lit album, which is the most morose and triumphant of Drake's career. "My
                        life's a completed checklist," he boasts on "Tuscan Leather"-- for Drake, it's another reason to
                        feel superior. But it's also what you say right before you die, and I can't imagine an admission
                        more depressing.</p>
