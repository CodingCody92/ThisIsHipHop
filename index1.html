            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-9">
                    <p>J. Cole is at a pivotal point in his legacy.</p>

                    <p> Since 2018’s underwhelming “KOD” release, J. Cole’s rapping has been at its all-time peak. His
                        2018 and 2019 feature run will go down as one of the high points of his career, and he’s made
                        remarkable contributions to various artists’ songs, including on 21 Savage’s “A Lot” and on his
                        Dreamville label’s album “Revenge Of The Dreamers III.” Cole released two of the best features
                        of his entire career on “Under the Sun” and “Sacrifices.” </p>

                    <p> But many people — myself included — feel like he doesn’t quite yet have an incredible solo album
                        in his discography, and it’s holding him back from being considered one of the greats in
                        hip-hop. Even as a big Cole fan myself, I feel that his studio albums typically don’t live up to
                        the standards he sets on mixtapes and features, where most of his best work has come by way of
                        loose tracks, mixtapes, EPs and collaborations. </p>

                    <hr>

                    <p> “The Off-Season” gives Cole a chance to reform his studio album reputation, and to cement his
                        legacy as an all time great in rap music. Thankfully, Cole is continuing to rap at the high
                        level he has consistently held over the last three years. Despite some small structural flaws,
                        “The Off-Season” is a more than satisfactory effort, and it provides some of the greatest music
                        of his career. </p>

                    <p> Cole’s dedication to the craft, to getting better at it every day, is commendable. Whether that
                        commitment leads to a more entertaining product is debatable. Given The Off-Season’s status as
                        an
                        ostensible set-up for whatever “The Fall-Off” portion of J. Cole’s career will be, it’s possible
                        that he’s just giving us a rare glimpse into the amount of forethought and skill polishing that
                        goes
                        into setting up a 20+year career. That’s pretty cool, but some of us will be looking forward to
                        watching the actual game footage, not just the practice highlights. </p>

                    <p>The Off-Season is out now via Dreamville. Get it <a class="album"
