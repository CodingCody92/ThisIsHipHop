                    <p> The Migos are in the building once again. For their comeback track setting the stage for
                        <em>Culture
                            III</em>, the
                        Atlanta trio returned to their roots for the <em>“Straightenin”</em> video on Friday (May 14).

                        Quavo, Offset and Takeoff are all multi-millionaires, but they headed back to the trap to get to
                        do what
                        they know best for the gritty visual. With that said, the Grammy-nominated group still had to
                        add the
                        signature Migos flair, with a lineup of exotic whips flossing all over the city.

                    <p>
                        YoungBoy Never Broke Again was taken into FBI custody following a dramatic foot pursuit with the
                        Los Angeles Police Department in late March and he’s been behind bars ever since. As the Baton
                        Rouge rapper awaits trial, he’s apparently been keeping busy by writing letters and
                        communicating with his fans. </p>
                    <p>
                        On Friday (May 14), one of those letters surfaced online and revealed YoungBoy is having yet
                        another child, this time with his purported girlfriend Jazlyn Mychelle.
                    </p>

                    <p> “I’m a man before anything,” he wrote in part. “I had to apologize to myself for not protecting
                        my heart and allowing most of this to happen i read letters from my supporters and find joy
                        inside and yes i said that right (my supporters) y’all are not fans we scream F.A.N together
                        (fuck a n-gga) LOL but all jokes aside i ain’t got nothing against nobody i dont want no problem
                        neither just stop speaking on me we don’t concern each other.”</p>

                    <p> He continued, “I really just want to be there when my daughter born i want to be in the same
                        house as her while she grow up i never had that experience. Jaz im sorry (ma’ma) i promise im
                        sorry for every time i said something to another woman for every time they ever gotten the
                        chance to come around ill give you anything for you not to leave anything to have you when its
                        all said and done.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        YoungBoy Never Broke Again welcomed his seventh child in January along with the mother Yaya
                        Mayweather, roughly one month after he reportedly witnessed the birth of his sixth child. The
                        21-year-old rapper (yes, 21) has been embroiled in drama with the women in his life since he
                        stepped into the public spotlight. </p>
                    <p>

                        In April 2020, Yaya was arrested for felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and briefly
                        held at Houston’s Harris County Jail. At the time, law enforcement explained she’d had a
                        confrontation with another mother of YoungBoy’s child, Lapattra Lashai Jacobs, at YoungBoy’s
                        home. When Yaya arrived at the house, she told Jacobs she was YoungBoy’s fiancée and ordered her
                        to leave.

        <h4>Chicago rapper Lil Reese among 3 shot in parking garage</h4>

        <img src="https://imagez.tmz.com/image/8e/4by3/2021/05/15/8e12c05ad3314ebd868046db9a3db41a_md.jpg" alt="reese">

                <div class="col-9">
                    <p>
                        CHICAGO, IL – Lil Reese and two other men were reportedly shot in a Chicago parking lot on
                        Saturday morning (May 15).</p>
                    <p>

                        According to CWB Chicago, police responded to a shots fired call around 9:53 a.m. local time and
                        found three victims with gunshot wounds. A police spokesperson citing preliminary information
                        said the incident involved several people who were “all shooting at each other.”</p>
                    <p>
                        A stolen Dodge Durango sprayed with bullet holes was discovered crashed at the scene, while
                        video of the officers’ arrival was posted to Twitter.
                    </p>

                    <p>Lil Reese was identified as one of the victims while the other two victims are a 20-year-old man
                        and a 27-year-old man. All three of them were taken to local hospitals, but their conditions are
                        unknown.</p>

                    <p> Of course, this isn’t the first time Lil Reese has been shot. In November 2019, the 28-year-old
                        rapper was critically injured when he was shot in the neck by a man armed with an AK47 assault
                        rifle.</p>

                    <p> At the time, police said officers responded to the intersection of 167th Street and Pulaski Road
                        in south Country Club Hills after they received reports of a shooting. Once they arrived on the
                        scene, officers found a vehicle with fresh blood in the driver’s seat and on the ground next to
                        the door.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Police checked nearby hospitals and located a male with a gunshot wound to the neck area at
                        South Suburban Hospital’s emergency room in Hazel Crest who turned out to be Reese. He was
                        ultimately transferred to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn.</p>

                    <p>Although he survived the shooting, Reese lost his voice and has struggled to regain it ever
                        since. Over the past several months, Lil Reese has engaged in online beef with both 6ix9ine and
                        Quando Rondo, who was involved in the death of Reese’s fellow Chicagoan King Von.</p>

                    <p> This is a developing story. </p>
